Introduction

The following graphs show production and prices
for all sectors. For the primary sectors the embedded
CO2 is displayed. For the consumer it shows the
welfare.


Secondary sectors don't produce CO2 other than what
is already accounted for in the primary sectors'
CO2 output.

The first 50 periods of the simulation are not
displayed, as they serve to set up the model. At
period 100, the new policy is implemented. The user
can observe the CO2 output before and after the
introduction of the new tax policy.

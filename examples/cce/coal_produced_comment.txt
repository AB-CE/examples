Often immediately after the introduction 
of a new tax regime the economy reacts 
very strongly or exhibits fluctuations. 
This is a model limitation. In reality, 
firms and consumers have foresight, which 
gives them the ability to smooth their 
production and consumption decisions.
The model agents don't have this ability
and therefore we see strong fluctuations.
